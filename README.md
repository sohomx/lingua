### The script performs the following major steps:

- Imports necessary libraries and sets up the OpenAI API key.
- Retrieves the essay content and creates an index for retrieval.
- Defines a question and retrieves relevant contexts using the index.
- Utilizes LLMLingua and OpenAI to generate a response to the question.
- Further processes the retrieved nodes for context compression and refinement.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to adapt it to your specific use cases or questions.
